Release notes for version 1.9 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.


The 1.9 release adds CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) support, more
specifically it adds support for the subfonts used in the CJK-latex
package.

TrueType fonts have been tested somewhat more, and the ttfonts.map
file is now used, if present on the system.

It also fixes a few bugs, most notably a version problem with
Freetype<2.1.8, and a graphics inclusion bug for non-.-paths.


Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.
