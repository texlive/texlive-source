Release notes for version 1.11 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.


The 1.11 release is a regression fix for v 1.10.

From v 1.10, dvipng will be available under the LGPL rather than the
GPL. This is because the GPL restricts inclusion in some rendering
systems out there. I have decided to change to LGPL because a) there
are other possible albeit slower conversion paths from DVI to PNG, and
b) dvipng has been available (pre-release and release) for five years
now, which should be enough of a head start for the GNU community.


The main code addition in v 1.10 is limited support for literal
PostScript specials, using gs. For example, most of the PSTricks
package can now be rendered using dvipng. Unfortunately, dvipng can
only handle drawing PostScript code at the moment, not PostScript code
intended to make dvips + gs scale, rotate, or move DVI glyphs
(characters).  This is because the graphics state cannot be
communicated back to dvipng from gs. So no guarantees. Also, the
performance in terms of runtime could be better.

Other changes include internal changes to the DVI stack, DVI flags,
some build issues on AIX and glyph-index-checking fixes.
