Release notes for version 1.12 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.


The main code addition in v 1.12 is to allow usage of recent versions
of the xcolor package, which also will reenable much of the PSTricks
package. 

Still it is the case that dvipng can only handle drawing PostScript
code at the moment, not PostScript code intended to make dvips + gs
scale, rotate, or move DVI glyphs (characters).  This is because the
graphics state cannot be communicated back to dvipng from gs. So no
guarantees. Also, the performance in terms of runtime could be better.

Other changes include a fix for inclusion of bitmaps with transparent
background and a typo in the file-handling code on machines that do
not have mmap.


Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.
