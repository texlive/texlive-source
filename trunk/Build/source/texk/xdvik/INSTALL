Compiling and Installing Xdvik
==============================

Xdvik is the kpathsea-enhanced version of xdvi. The program
invocation name is still `xdvi' for compatibility reasons.

Please submit bug reports, suggestions etc. to the sourceforge
xdvik project page:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdvi/


Note for users of older versions of teTeX (<= teTeX-1.0):
=========================================================

   Please consult  the README file in the texk/xdvik/texmf-alt/
   directory of the source distribution.


Note for users of non-teTeX installations:
==========================================

   Please consult the files texk/xdvik/texmf-alt/README and
   texk/xdvik/README.t1fonts for information on how to configure
   xdvik for direct Type1 font rendering.


1. Required Software

   - X11R5 or newer and the Xt libraries

   and one of:

   - Xaw (Athena widgets)

   - Motif >= 1.2 or newer
     LessTif has a few bugs and restrictions that will result in limited
     functionality (see the file texk/xdvik/LESSTIF-BUGS for details).
     For best results, use OpenMotif 2.x.

   You need both the headers and the runtime libraries to compile and run
   xdvik (note that some Linux distributors put the headers into separate
   `X development' pacakges).

2. Configuring:

   In the top-level directory (the directory in which this INSTALL
   file is located), invoke:

	./configure

   You can also specify a toolkit via the --with-x-toolkit option
   (the default is to check if Motif is available and use it if it is):

       ./configure --with-x-toolkit=xaw [other-options]

   will compile with Xaw (Athena widgets) instead. You can set
   the search paths for Motif header/library files with the
   --with-motif-include and --with-motif-libdir options.

   If configure gives you errors about the main texmf tree not being
   found, specify its directory via the `--datadir' option.
   On a standard teTeX system, use the output of the command:

	kpsewhich --expand-path='$TEXMFMAIN'

   *without* the `texmf' component as value for `--datadir'
   (/usr/share or /usr/local/teTeX/share are possible values).

   For all configuration options available, see the output of:
       ./configure --help



3. Compiling:

   In the top-level directory, invoke:

        make

   This should compile the executable texk/xdvik/xdvi-TOOLKIT.bin,
   where TOOLKIT is the value of the `--with-x-toolkit' specified
   in the configure step, e.g. `xaw' or `motif' (the default).

   If you set the environment variable XDVIINPUTS to the path
   containing the files xdvi.cfg and ps2pk.map, you should be
   able to test xdvi without actually installing it.



4. Installation:

   Usually, the binary xdvi-TOOLKIT.bin is invoked by a shell wrapper
   `xdvi' which sets XDVIINPUTS and some other variables, like the X
   search path.

   If you only want to upgrade an existing version of xdvik, it should
   be sufficient to copy xdvi-TOOLKIT.bin into a directory in your PATH
   and check that the shell wrapper invokes the correct toolkit version.
   (You may also want to update the man page from xdvi.1). These files
   are located in the texk/xdvik subdirectory.

   To install a new version from scratch, invoke:

	make install

   in the top-level directory to install all executable and data files.
   This will not install the files in the texk/kpathsea subdirectory,
   which is not required if you already have a working TeX installation
   (and actually could overwrite your existing setup). If you don't have
   kpathsea installed yet, you'll need to install it manually; basically
   by doing `cd texk/kpathsea; make install'. Please see the file
   texk/kpathsea/INSTALL for more information.



5. Setup:

   Make sure that the XDVIINPUTS variable (set in the system-wide
   texmf.cnf file or in the environment, e.g. in your .profile)
   contains the path to the directory DATADIR/texmf/xdvi, and
   to the file ps2pk.map (usually in DATADIR/texmf/dvips);
   e.g. by setting:

	export XDVIINPUTS='.;$TEXMF/{xdvi,dvips}//'

   If xdvik is still generating PK versions of fonts that you think
   you have Type1 versions of, please consult texk/xdvik/README.t1fonts
   for more information on how to configure xdvik correctly for Type1
   fonts.
