.SH NAME
makempy \- Helper script for conversion of (PDF or PostScript) text to
\fBMetaPost\fP graphics
.PP
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
\fBmakempy\fP \fIfilenam\fP
.PP 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmakempy\fP takes \fBMetapost\fP output files (*\&.mpo) and
translates them to *\&.mpy files. In order to include text as a
graphic into a file typeset with (Con)TeX(t), you extract the text
from Postscript of PDF files using \fBpdftops\fP and \fBpstoedit\fP,
creating a Metapost input file.
.PP
This file can then be processed by \fBmakempy\fP. The \fBmakempy\fP
script does its work without user intervention. When it deduces that
there are no changes, it will not run at all, otherwise it will report
its steps and/or encountered error.
