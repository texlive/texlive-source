source/texk/texlive/linked_scripts
==================================

This directory contains copies of the scripts that are shipped within
TeX Live. 

Steps to add a new script:
--------------------------
* create a directory with the package name, and add the script
* add the dir/script-name to Makefile.am in the respective section
  (shell vs general interpreter, texmf vs texmf-dist)
* add the package/script to ctan2tds so that is found and installed automatically
* get ctan2tl run properly
* (reautoconf?)

Other explanation from Makefile.am
----------------------------------
# The idea is to install the scripts themselves in texmf*/scripts, and
# have bin/arch/foo be a symlink to, say,
# ../../texmf-dist/scripts/foo/foo.pl.  That way we save a bit of disk
# space, but more importantly omit duplication, and most
# importantly of all make it possible to invoke the same Perl script on
# Windows (see ../w32_wrapper).
#
# The installation into texmf*/scripts is ideally done with ctan2tl.
# The copy of the wrapper for Windows is also done by ctan2tl.  (And
# for shell scripts, its addition must be undone by hand.)  The
# check-wrapper-consistency script checks after the fact for problems.
#
# We also keep a copy of all the scripts here and install into the runtime.
# This is purely for other distro builders, so symlinks are not dangling in
# the inst/bin dir (it is meaningless in native TL).  We have not yet
# written the auto-update to ensure linked_scripts is actually up to date
# with the masters in Master/texmf*/scripts, but one day.
#
# We support native builds, multiplatform or not, as well as distro builds.
