	Version 1.12 of the omfonts programs
	====================================
	     ( p r e l i m i n a r y )

This directory contains a new Web Version 1.12 of the Omega font conversion
programs ofm2opl, opl2ofm, ovf2ovp, and ovp2ovf.

After numerous bugfixes and with a slightly modification of one algorithm
the programs are now able to process ofm_level=-1 (TFM/VF) as well as
ofm_level=0,1 (OFM/OVF) files.  A virtual font and the local fonts can use
any combination of these ofm levels.

For the moment VF/OVF files read by ovf2ovp must have the extension '.ovf',
allowing '.vf' as alternative requires a modification of the Kpathsea
library that will not be present in TL2009.

Note, however, that all this is still somewhat preliminary.  In particular
the programs still lack the thorough checking of all input data done in
TFtoPL&Co and required to diagnose problems with faulty binary files.
