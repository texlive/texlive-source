dvitty is intended for previewing dvi-files on text-only devices
(terminals and lineprinters). The output is not very pretty many
times, but it still saves quite a lot of work, especially if you
have a little ways to walk to a laserprinter, for example.

The program was originally written in Hedrick-Pascal, running on
TOPS-20, and was later ported to UNIX (BSD, Berkeley-pascal).

It is not very smart in all situations, but still serves it pur-
pose fairly well.

For information on how to use see the man-page.

Before compiling and installing inspect the  "compile-time cust-
omization constants" and change them to suit your site.
These constants configure default pager and a little more.
