	Convert from autoconf-2.13 to autoconf-2.59+:
	* Makefile.in: Add @configure_input@ line.
	* aclocal.m4 (new): Generated (aclocal -I ../m4).
	* configure: Regenerated (autoconf).

	* build scripts: provide configure(.in) and Makefile.in so that
	dvipos builds cleanly with kpathsea and for the TeXLive
	architectures.

	* dvicore.c: do_pos_special() needed two fixes in its interaction
	with ConTeXt.  [As far as I know, ConTeXt in dvi mode is the only
	user of dvipos.]

	First, it was writing out coordinates for the pos \specials using
	scaled points but not appending the sp to the magnitudes.  So when
	the ConTeXt macros read in the .tuo file, they complained about
	missing dimensions and assumed the coordinates were given in pt, a
	factor of 65536 different from sp.  The simplest fix was to still
	write scaled points but to append 'sp' to the magnitudes.

	Second, the 'list' variable needed to become a struct containing
	hsize, leftskip, rightskip, hangindent, hangafter, parindent.
	This struct is sscanf'ed into when do_pos_special() is parsing a a
	pos:pxywhd special in the dvi file, and do_pos_special() uses the
	information to write the corresponding \\pospxyplus command for
	the .tuo file.

	* Wrote dvipos!  [In the distant past, its functions were done in
	a Perl script written by Taco Hoekwater.]
