Changes applied to the dvipdfmx-20110309 tree as obtained from:
	http://project.ktug.or.kr/dvipdfmx/snapshot/latest/dvipdfmx-20110309.tar.gz

patch-00-cfg changes dvipdfmx.cfg to use rungs instead of the default
ps2pdf -dSAFER, to avoid complete pstricks failure with xetex.  There is
no need to apply this in the source tree, but it must be applied in the
runtime (Master/texmf/dvipdfmx).

Removed:
	NEWS
	compile
	depcomp
	install-sh
	missing
