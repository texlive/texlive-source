Musixflx implements the second pass of a three-pass system described in
Section 1.3 of the MusiXTeX manual.

This version (0.83.2) incorporates a number of small improvements
by Peter Breitenlohner and the introduction of MUSIXFLXVERSION to
distinguish between "local" changes and changes that affect MusiXTeX;
see the ChangeLog.

Ross Mitchell has by e-mail authorized distribution of this version.
