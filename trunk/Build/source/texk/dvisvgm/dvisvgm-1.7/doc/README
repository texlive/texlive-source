dvisvgm-1.6 (2014-04-22)
- added option --zoom to "visually" scale the generated SVG graphics while
  preserving the original size and position values of the graphic objects
- extended argument syntax of option --linkmark to allow to select the
  box/line color
- changed default link marker from 'line' to 'box'
- changed link markers to be only split on line breaks while extended in all
  other cases
- if libgs is not directly linked to the binary, dvisvgm now looks for
  libgs.so.X instead of libgs.so (supported GS ABIs: X = 7, 8, 9)
- removed time stamp and machine triplet from generated SVG files
- some code improvements and refactorings
