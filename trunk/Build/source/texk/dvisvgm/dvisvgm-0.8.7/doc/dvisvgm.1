.SH "NAME"
dvisvgm \- converts DVI files to the XML\-based SVG format
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBdvisvgm\fR [ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIfile\fR [\&.dvi]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The program \fBdvisvgm\fR generates an SVG file from a given DVI file\&. DVI is the device independent output format produced by TeX and some other typesetting systems\&. Output from groff can be converted to DVI using grodvi\&.
.sp
The recent version of \fBdvisvgm\fR provides advanced conversion functionality but currently only one page can be converted even if the DVI file is made up of multiple pages\&. You can select the page to be processed with option \fB\-p\fR\&. \fBdvisvgm\fR should properly convert all pages that are made up of fonts and rules only\&. Additionally, some sets of specials are understood as well\&. For a more detailed overview, see section \fBsupport of specials\fR below\&.
.sp
Since SVG is a vector based graphics format, \fBdvisvgm\fR tries to convert the glyph outlines of all used fonts into scalable path descriptions\&. The fastest way to do that is to extract the path information from PFB (PostScript Type 1) files\&. So if \fBdvisvgm\fR is able to find a PFB file for a used font, it will read the necessary information from it\&.
.sp
TeX\(cqs main source for font descriptions is Metafont which produces bitmap output \&.That\(cqs why not all obtainable TeX fonts are available in PFB format\&. In these cases \fBdvisvgm\fR tries to vectorize Metafont\(cqs output by tracing the glyph bitmaps\&. The results are not as perfect as most (manually optimized) PFB outlines but are nonetheless really nice in most cases\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-a, \-\-trace\-all\fR
.RS 4
This option forces dvisvgm to trace not just the actually needed glyphs but all glyphs of all bitmap fonts used in the DVI file\&. Since the tracing results are stored in the font cache, all following DVI conversions (without option
\fB\-\-trace\-all\fR) where these fonts are involved will be much faster\&. By default, dvisvgm traces only the actually needed glyphs and adds them to the cache\&.

cannot be combined with option

.PP
\fB\-b, \-\-bbox\fR=\fIfmt\fR
.RS 4
Sets the bounding box of the generated graphic to the specified format\&. The parameter
\fIfmt\fR
takes either one of the format specifiers listed below or a sequence of four comma\- or whitespace\-separated length values
\fIx1\fR,
\fIy1\fR,
\fIx2\fR
and
\fIy2\fR\&. The latter define two diagonal corners of the bounding box\&. Each length value consists of a floating point number and an optional length unit (pt, bp, cm, mm, in, or pc)\&. If the unit is omitted, TeX points (pt) are assumed\&.
.sp
Alternatively, the following format specifiers are supported:

\fBPage orientation\fR

The default page orientation for DIN/ISO and American paper sizes is
\fIportrait\fR, i\&.e\&.
\fIwidth\fR

\fIheight\fR\&. Appending
\fB\-landscape\fR
or simply
\fB\-l\fR
to the format string switches to
\fIlandscape\fR
mode (\fIwidth\fR
>
\fIheight\fR)\&. For symmetry reasons you can also explicitly add
\fB\-portrait\fR
or
\fB\-p\fR
to indicate the default portrait format\&. Note that these suffixes are part of the size string and not separate options\&. Thus they must directly follow the above mentioned size specifiers without additional blanks\&. Furthermore, the orientation suffixes can\(cqt be used with
\fBdvi\fR,
\fBmin\fR
and
\fBnone\fR\&.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-C, \-\-cache\fR[=\fIdir\fR]
.RS 4
To speed up the conversion process of bitmap fonts,
\fBdvisvgm\fR
saves intermediate conversion information in cache files\&. By default, these files are stored in $HOME/\&.dvisvgm\&. If you prefer a different location use option
\fB\-\-cache\fR
to overwrite the default\&. Furthermore, it is also possible to disable the font caching mechanism completely with option
\fB\-\-cache=none\fR\&. If argument
\fIdir\fR
is omitted, dvisvgm prints the path of the default cache directory and some information about the stored fonts\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l, \-\-list\-specials\fR
.RS 4
Prints a list of registered special handlers and exits\&. Each handler processes a set of special statements belonging to the same category\&. The categories are identified by the prefix of the special statements\&. It\(cqs usually a leading word separated from the rest of the statement by a colon or a blank, e\&.g\&.
\fIcolor\fR
or
\fIps\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m, \-\-map\-file\fR=\fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Sets the map file that is used to look up font names and encodings\&.
\fBdvisvgm\fR
does not provide its own map file but tries to use available ones coming with
\fBdvips\fR
or
\fBdvipdfm\fR\&. If option
\fB\-m\fR
is not given
\fBdvisvgm\fR
looks for
ps2pk\&.map,
dvipdfm\&.map, and
psfonts\&.map
(in this order)\&. Without further options, the file specified by option
\fB\-m\fR
will be used instead of the default maps\&. If you want
\fBdvisgvm\fR
to load the given file additionally to the default maps, add a leading
\fI+\fR
to the file/path, e\&.g\&.
\-\-map\-file=+myfonts\&.map\&. For further information about the file format see the manuals of
\fBdvips\fR
and
\fBdvipdfm\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M, \-\-mag\fR=\fIfactor\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maginfication factor used for Metafont calls prior tracing the glyphs\&. The larger this value the better the tracing results\&. Nevertheless large magnification values can cause Metafont arithmetic errors due to number overflows\&. So use this option with care\&. The default setting usually produces nice results\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n, \-\-no\-fonts\fR
.RS 4
If this option is given,
\fBdvisvgm\fR
doesn\(cqt create font elements but uses paths instead\&. The resulting SVG file is usually bigger but concurrently more compatible with most applications that don\(cqt support SVG fonts yet\&. This option implies
\fB\-\-no\-styles\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S, \-\-no\-specials\fR[=\fInames\fR]
.RS 4
Disable processing of special commands that are embedded in the DVI file\&. If no further parameter is given, all specials are ignored\&. To selectively disable sets of specials, an optional comma\-separated list of names can be appended to this option\&. A
\fIname\fR
is a unique identifier referencing a special handler\&. Option
\fB\-\-list\-specials\fR
lists all currently available handlers and their names\&. All unsupported special statements are silently ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-styles\fR
.RS 4
By default,
\fBdvisvgm\fR
uses CSS styles and class attributes to reference fonts because it\(cqs more compact than repeatedly set the complete font information in each text element\&. However, if you prefer direct font references, the default behavior can be disabled with option
\fB\-\-no\-styles\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-mktexmf\fR
.RS 4
Suppresses the generation of missing font files\&. If
\fBdvisvgm\fR
can\(cqt find a font file through the kpathsea lookup mechanism, it calls the external tools mktextfm or mktexmf by default\&. This option disables these calls\&.

Sets the name of the output file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p, \-\-page\fR=\fInumber\fR
.RS 4
With this option you can choose the page to be processed\&. Please consider that the parameter of this option don\(cqt refer to the page numbers printed on the page\&. Instead the physical page count is expected, where the first page always gets number 1\&. If this option is omitted, the first page will be selected\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P, \-\-progress\fR[=\fIskip\fR]
.RS 4
Enables a simple progress indicator shown when DVI specials are processed, since this can be a time\-consuming operation, especially when PostScript specials are involved\&. The optional non\-negative parameter
\fIskip\fR
controls the indicator length: Every time a set of
\fIskip\fR
specials has been processed, an indicator character is printed\&. Therefore, smaller values lead to a longer, more frequently updated progress indicator\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r, \-\-rotate\fR=\fIangle\fR

Rotates page content clockwise by
\fIangle\fR
degrees around the page center\&. This option is equivalent to

.PP
\fBT\fR \fItx\fR[,\fIty\fR]
.RS 4
Translates (moves) page in direction of vector (\fItx\fR,\fIty\fR)\&. If
\fIty\fR
is omitted,
\fIty\fR=0 is assumed\&. The expected unit length of
\fItx\fR

\fBdvisvgm\fR supports several sets of special commands that can be used to enrich DVI files with additional features, like color, graphics or hyperlinks\&. The evaluation of special commands is done by various handlers, where each handler is responsible for all special statements of the same command set, i\&.e\&. commands beginning with the same prefix\&.

Special statement for changing the background/page color\&. Since SVG 1\&.1 doesn\(cqt support background colors,
\fBdvisvgm\fR
inserts a rectangle of the chosen color\&. In the current version, this rectangle always gets the size of the minimal bounding box\&.

\fIwidth\fR,
\fIheight\fR) where the lower left corner is located at the current DVI drawing position (\fIx\fR,\fIy\fR)\&. If the optional parameter
