.SH "NAME"
dvisvgm \- converts DVI files to the XML\-based SVG format
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBdvisvgm\fR [ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIfile\fR [\&.dvi]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The command\-line utility \fBdvisvgm\fR converts DVI files, as generated by TeX/LaTeX, to the XML\-based scalable vector graphics format SVG\&. Since the current SVG standard 1\&.1 doesn\(cqt specify multi\-page graphics, \fBdvisvgm\fR creates separate SVG files for each DVI page\&. Because of compatibility reasons, only the first page is converted by default\&. In order to select a different page or arbitrary page sequences, use option \fB\-p\fR which is described below\&.
.sp
\fBdvisvgm\fR should properly convert all pages that are made up of fonts and rules only\&. However, the utility also supports a couple of DVI extensions defined in terms of \fIDVI specials\fR\&. For a more detailed overview, see section \fBsupport of specials\fR below\&.
.sp
As SVG is a vector based graphics format, \fBdvisvgm\fR tries to convert the glyph outlines of all used fonts into scalable path descriptions\&. The fastest way to do that is to extract the path information from PFB (PostScript Type 1) files\&. So, if \fBdvisvgm\fR is able to find a PFB file for a required font, it will read the necessary information from it\&.
.sp
TeX\(cqs main source for font descriptions is Metafont though, which produces bitmap output\&. That\(cqs why not all obtainable TeX fonts are available in PFB format\&. In these cases \fBdvisvgm\fR tries to vectorize Metafont\(cqs output (GF fonts) by tracing the glyph bitmaps\&. The results are not as perfect as most (manually optimized) PFB outlines but are nonetheless really nice in most cases\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-a, \-\-trace\-all\fR=[\fIretrace\fR]
.RS 4
This option forces dvisvgm to trace not just the actually needed glyphs but all glyphs of all bitmap fonts used in the DVI file\&. Since the tracing results are stored in the font cache, all following DVI conversions (without option
\fB\-\-trace\-all\fR) where these fonts are involved will be much faster\&. By default, dvisvgm traces only the actually needed glyphs and adds them to the cache\&. The boolean option
\fIretrace\fR
determines how to handle glyphs that are already stored in the cache\&. By default, these glyphs are skipped\&. Setting argument
\fIretrace\fR
to
\fIyes\fR
or
\fItrue\fR
forces dvisvgm to trace the corresponding bitmaps again\&.

.PP
\fB\-b, \-\-bbox\fR=\fIfmt\fR
.RS 4
Sets the bounding box of the generated graphic to the specified format\&. The parameter
\fIfmt\fR
takes either one of the format specifiers listed below or a sequence of four comma\- or whitespace\-separated length values
\fIx1\fR,
\fIy1\fR,
\fIx2\fR
and
\fIy2\fR\&. The latter define two diagonal corners of the bounding box\&. Each length value consists of a floating point number and an optional length unit (pt, bp, cm, mm, in, or pc)\&. If the unit is omitted, TeX points (pt) are assumed\&.
.sp
It\(cqs also possible to give only one length value
\fIl\fR\&. In this case the minimal bounding box is computed and enlarged by adding (\-\fIl\fR,\-\fIl\fR) to the upper left and (\fIl\fR,\fIl\fR) to the lower right corner\&.
.sp
Alternatively, the following format specifiers are supported:

\fBPage orientation\fR
.RS 4
The default page orientation for DIN/ISO and American paper sizes is
\fIportrait\fR, i\&.e\&.
\fIwidth\fR

\fIheight\fR\&. Appending
\fB\-landscape\fR
or simply
\fB\-l\fR
to the format string switches to
\fIlandscape\fR
mode (\fIwidth\fR
>
\fIheight\fR)\&. For symmetry reasons you can also explicitly add
\fB\-portrait\fR
or
\fB\-p\fR
to indicate the default portrait format\&. Note that these suffixes are part of the size string and not separate options\&. Thus they must directly follow the above mentioned size specifiers without additional blanks\&. Furthermore, the orientation suffixes can\(cqt be used with
\fBdvi\fR,
\fBmin\fR

\fBnone\fR\&.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-C, \-\-cache\fR[=\fIdir\fR]
.RS 4
To speed up the conversion process of bitmap fonts,
\fBdvisvgm\fR
saves intermediate conversion information in cache files\&. By default, these files are stored in $HOME/\&.dvisvgm\&. If you prefer a different location use option
\fB\-\-cache\fR
to overwrite the default\&. Furthermore, it is also possible to disable the font caching mechanism completely with option
\fB\-\-cache=none\fR\&. If argument
\fIdir\fR
is omitted, dvisvgm prints the path of the default cache directory and some information about the stored fonts\&.

Enables colorization of messages printed during the conversion process\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e, \-\-exact\fR
.RS 4
If this option is given, dvisvgm computes the precise bounding box of each character\&. By default, the values stored in the font\(cqs TFM file are used to determine a glyph\(cqs extent\&. As these values are intended to realize optimal character placements and are not designed to represent the exact dimensions, they don\(cqt necessarily correspond with the bounds of the visual glyphs\&. Thus, the width and/or height of some glyphs may be larger than the respective TFM values\&. As a result, this can lead to clipped characters at the bounds of the SVG graphic\&. With option
\fB\-\-exact\fR, dvisvgm analyzes the actual shape of each character and derives a usually tight bounding box\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Prints a short summary of all available command\-line options\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-libgs=filename\fR
.RS 4
This option is only available if the Ghostscript library is not directly linked to dvisvgm and PostScript support was not completely disabled\&. In this case, dvisvgm tries to load the shared GS library dynamically during runtime\&. By default, it expects the library\(cqs name to be libgs\&.so (Linux) or gsdll32\&.dll (Windows)\&. Option
\fB\-\-libgs\fR
can be used to give a different name\&. Alternatively, the GS library name can also be set by the environment variable
\fBLIBGS\fR\&. The latter has a less precedence than the command\-line option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l, \-\-list\-specials\fR
.RS 4
Prints a list of registered special handlers and exits\&. Each handler processes a set of special statements belonging to the same category\&. The categories are identified by the prefix of the special statements\&. It\(cqs usually a leading word separated from the rest of the statement by a colon or a blank, e\&.g\&.
\fIcolor\fR

\fIps\fR\&.
.RE

\fB\-m, \-\-map\-file\fR=\fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Sets the map file that is used to look up font names and encodings\&.
\fBdvisvgm\fR
does not provide its own map file but tries to use available ones coming with
\fBdvips\fR
or
\fBdvipdfm\fR\&. If option
\fB\-m\fR
is not given
\fBdvisvgm\fR
looks for
ps2pk\&.map,
dvipdfm\&.map, and
psfonts\&.map
(in this order)\&. Without further options, the file specified by option
\fB\-m\fR
will be used instead of the default maps\&. If you want
\fBdvisgvm\fR
to load the given file additionally to the default maps, add a leading
\fI+\fR
to the file/path, e\&.g\&.
\-\-map\-file=+myfonts\&.map\&. For further information about the file format see the manuals of
\fBdvips\fR
and
\fBdvipdfm\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M, \-\-mag\fR=\fIfactor\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maginfication factor used for Metafont calls prior tracing the glyphs\&. The larger this value the better the tracing results\&. Nevertheless large magnification values can cause Metafont arithmetic errors due to number overflows\&. So use this option with care\&. The default setting usually produces nice results\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n, \-\-no\-fonts\fR
.RS 4
If this option is given,
\fBdvisvgm\fR
doesn\(cqt create font elements but uses paths instead\&. The resulting SVG file is usually bigger but concurrently more compatible with most applications that don\(cqt support SVG fonts yet\&. This option implies
\fB\-\-no\-styles\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S, \-\-no\-specials\fR[=\fInames\fR]
.RS 4
Disable processing of special commands that are embedded in the DVI file\&. If no further parameter is given, all specials are ignored\&. To selectively disable sets of specials, an optional comma\-separated list of names can be appended to this option\&. A
\fIname\fR
is a unique identifier referencing a special handler\&. Option
\fB\-\-list\-specials\fR
lists all currently available handlers and their names\&. All unsupported special statements are silently ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-styles\fR
.RS 4
By default,
\fBdvisvgm\fR
uses CSS styles and class attributes to reference fonts because it\(cqs more compact than repeatedly set the complete font information in each text element\&. However, if you prefer direct font references, the default behavior can be disabled with option
\fB\-\-no\-styles\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-mktexmf\fR
.RS 4
Suppresses the generation of missing font files\&. If
\fBdvisvgm\fR
can\(cqt find a font file through the kpathsea lookup mechanism, it calls the external tools mktextfm or mktexmf by default\&. This option disables these calls\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o, \-\-output\fR=\fIpattern\fR
.RS 4
Sets the name pattern of the output file\&. The parameter
\fIpattern\fR
is a string that may contain the variables
\fB%f\fR
and
\fB%p\fR\&.
\fB%f\fR
stands for the base name of the DVI file, i\&.e\&. the DVI filename without suffix, and
\fB%p\fR
is the current page number\&. By default, the pattern is
\fB%f\-%p\&.svg\fR
if the DVI file consists of more than one page, and
\fB%f\&.svg\fR
otherwise\&. That means, a DVI file
\fIfoo\&.dvi\fR
is converted to
\fIfoo\&.svg\fR
if
\fIfoo\&.dvi\fR
is a single\-page document\&. Otherwise, multiple SVG files
\fIfoo\-01\&.svg\fR,
\fIfoo\-02\&.svg\fR, etc\&. are produced\&. In Windows environments, the percent sign is used to get the value of environment variables, and must therefore be protected by a second percent sign, e\&.g\&.
\fB\-\-output=%%f\-%%p\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p, \-\-page\fR=\fIranges\fR
.RS 4
This option sets the pages to be processed\&. Parameter
\fIranges\fR
consists of a comma\-separated list of single page numbers and/or page ranges\&. A page range is a pair of numbers separated by a hyphen, e\&.g\&. 5\-12\&. Thus, a page sequence might look like this: 2\-4,6,9\-12,15\&. It doesn\(cqt matter if a page is given more than once or if page ranges overlap\&.
\fBdvisvgm\fR
always extracts the page numbers in ascending order and converts them only once\&. In order to stay compatible with previous versions, the default page sequence is 1\&. dvisvgm therefore converts only the first page and not the whole document in case option
\fB\-\-page\fR
is not given\&. Usually, page ranges consist of two numbers denoting the first and last page to be converted\&. If the conversion is to be started at page 1, or if it should continue up to the last DVI page, the first or second range number can be omitted, respectively\&. Example:
\fB\-\-page=\-10\fR
converts all pages up to page 10,
\fB\-\-page=10\-\fR
converts all pages starting with page 10\&. Please consider that the page values don\(cqt refer to the page numbers printed on the page\&. Instead, the physical page count is expected, where the first page always gets number 1\&.

These specials were introduced with the emTeX distribution by Eberhard Mattes\&. They provide line drawing statements, instructions for embedding MSP, PCX, and BMP image files, as well as two PCL commands\&.
\fBdvisvgm\fR
supports only the line drawing statements, all other em specials are silently ignored\&. A description of the command syntax can be found in the DVI driver documentation coming with emTeX (see CTAN)\&.

The famous DVI driver
\fBdvips\fR
introduced its own set of specials in order to embed PostScript code into DVI files, which greatly improves the capabilities of DVI documents\&. One aim of
\fBdvisvgm\fR
is to completely evaluate the PostScript code and to convert a large amount of it to SVG\&. Since PostScript is a rather complex language,
\fBdvisvgm\fR
does not try to implement its own PostScript interpreter but uses Ghostscript instead\&. If the Ghostscript library was not linked while building dvisvgm, it is looked up and dynamically loaded during runtime\&. In this case, dvisvgm looks for libgs\&.so on Linux systems, and gsdll32\&.dll on Windows\&. You can override these default file names with the environment variable LIBGS\&. The library must be installed and reachable through the PATH environment variable\&. If it cannot be found, the evaluation of PostScript specials is disabled\&. Use option
\fB\-\-list\-specials\fR
to check whether PS support is available, i\&.e\&. the entry
\fIps\fR
is present\&.

The TPIC special set defines instructions for drawing simple geometric objects\&. Some LaTeX packages, like eepic and tplot, use these specials to describe graphics\&.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.sp
\fBdvisvgm\fR uses the \fBkpathsea\fR library for locating the files that it opens\&. Hence, the environment variables described in the library\(cqs documentation influence the converter\&.
.sp
If dvisvgm was linked without the Ghostscript library and PostScript support has not been disabled, the shared Ghostscript library is looked up during runtime\&. The environment variable LIBGS can be used to specify the file name of library\&.
.sp
The pre\-compiled Windows version of \fBdvisvgm\fR requires a working installation of MiKTeX 2\&.7 or above\&. To enable evaluation of PostScript specials, the original Ghostscript DLL must be present\&.
.SH "FILES"

The location of the following files is determined by the kpathsea library\&. To check the actual kpathsea configuration you can use the \fBkpsewhich\fR utility\&.
