Known bugs in libpng version 1.2.14

1. April 22, 2001: pnggccrd.c has been reported to crash on NetBSD when
   reading interlaced PNG files, when assembler code is enabled but running
   on a non-MMX i386 platform.

   STATUS: Under investigation.  The change to pnggccrd.c in libpng-1.2.1
   fixed a problem under FreeBSD but not the problem with NetBSD, which
   still fails as of libpng-1.2.2rc1.

2. February 23, 2006: The custom makefiles don't build libpng with -lz.

   STATUS: This is a subject of debate. The change will probably be made
   as a part of a major overhaul of the makefiles in libpng version 1.3.0.

3. February 24, 2006: The Makefile generated by the "configure" script
   fails to install symbolic links
   libpng12.so => libpng12.so.0.1.2.9betaN
   that are generated by the custom makefiles.

   STATUS: For now, system library builders should use the custom makefiles.

4. November 15, 2006:  On some platforms (e.g. x86_64), there are unsatisfied
   references to some MMX functions.

   STATUS:  This is fixed in libpng-1.4.0, but in libpng-1.0.x and 1.2.x
   you have to put PNG_NO_MMX_CODE manually into pngconf.h.
