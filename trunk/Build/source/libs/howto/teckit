The teckit directory contains the source of the TECkit (Text Encoding Conversion
toolkit) library and tools. See http://scripts.sil.org/teckit.

The TECkit library is needed to build xetex.

The subtrees teckit/source/teckitjni and teckit/perl_binaries have been removed
as these are not relevant to building xetex or using the basic TECkit library.
The copy of zlib source code found in the teckit tree has also been removed.

The following files have been added:

  teckit.ac
  withenable.ac (currently empty)
