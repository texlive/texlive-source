	For a cross compilation Unix => mingw we certainly can't have this.
	This is just a minimal fix to build static libraries, but certainly
	not sufficient for icu-config.

	The whole scheme is broken for cross compilation, where
	CURR_FULL_DIR and CURR_SRCCODE_FULL_DIR should come from
	the native configuration of the build system.
