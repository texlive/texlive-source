This directory libs/icu/dummy does not build or install anything.  Its
purpose is to record the command line used to invoke
libs/icu/dummy/configure from libs/icu/configure.  This information is then
used by libs/icu/Makefile to invoke libs/icu/icu-xetex/configure from the
subdirectory libs/icu/icu-build without the need to adjust any absolute or
relative paths.
