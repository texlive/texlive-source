$Id: README 108 2007-05-20 20:03:54Z ms $

Herein is a (heavily butchered) version of the openbsd-compat "library" of
openssh 4.6 for use with pdfTeX. All files have their respective copyrights and
licenses (either BSD or public domain). Check them for license etc.

Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to martin@pdftex.org
