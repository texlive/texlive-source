	 * indicate what data to repeat from the dictionary buffer. Thus,
	 * the bigger the dictionary, the better compression ratio usually is.
	 *
	 * Maximum size of the dictionary depends on multiple things:
	 *  - Memory usage limit
	 *  - Available address space (not a problem on 64-bit systems)
	 *  - Selected match finder (encoder only)
	 *
	 * Currently the maximum dictionary size for encoding is 1.5 GiB

	 * will probably be the maximum).

	 * Decoder already supports dictionaries up to 4 GiB - 1 B (i.e.
	 * UINT32_MAX), so increasing the maximum dictionary size of the
	 * encoder won't cause problems for old decoders.
	 *
	 * Because extremely small dictionaries sizes would have unneeded
	 * overhead in the decoder, the minimum dictionary size is 4096 bytes.

	 *
	 * "The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that
	 * are likely to be encountered later in the data to be compressed,
	 * with the most commonly used strings preferably put towards the
	 * end of the dictionary. Using a dictionary is most useful when
	 * the data to be compressed is short and can be predicted with
	 * good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
	 * with the default empty dictionary."
	 * (From deflateSetDictionary() in zlib.h of zlib version 1.2.3)
	 *
	 * This feature should be used only in special situations.
	 * It works correctly only with raw encoding and decoding.
	 * Currently none of the container formats supported by
	 * liblzma allow preset dictionary when decoding, thus if
	 * you create a .lzma file with preset dictionary, it cannot
	 * be decoded with the regular .lzma decoder functions.
