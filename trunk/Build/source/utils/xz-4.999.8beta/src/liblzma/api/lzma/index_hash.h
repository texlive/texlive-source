 * \brief       Validates Index by using a hash function
 *
 * Instead of constructing complete Index while decoding Blocks, Index hash
 * calculates a hash of the Block sizes and Index, and then compares the
 * hashes. This way memory usage is constant even with large number of
 * Blocks and huge Index.
