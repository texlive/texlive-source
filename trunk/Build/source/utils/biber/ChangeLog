	* configure.ac (BIBER_EXE): AC_SUBST this, after detecting it.
	Call AC_CANONICAL_HOST and AC_EXEEXT to prepare for
	cross-compilation, maybe.
	* Makefile.am (bin_SCRIPTS): simplify to defining this
	as $(BIBER_EXE), which requires also defining this:
	(EXTRA_SCRIPTS): as empty, in our case.
	(EXTRA_DIST): TeXLive bin.
	* bin: new directory for binaries.
