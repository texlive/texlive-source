	* Moved to git. The repository is currently at
	git://ctrl.tukaani.org/lzma-utils-legacy.git but it
	may be moved in future. To see the detailed changelog,
	use git-log. This ChangeLog file won't be updated anymore.

2007-08-05  Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>

	* src/liblzmadec/lzmadec.h: Always include <sys/types.h>.
	Otherwise we don't get definition of off_t on some systems.
	Thanks to Phil Karn.

	* src/lzma/lzma.1: Typofixes for `--license' and `--version'.
	Thanks to Chris AtLee.
	* src/lzma/lzma.1: Removed `ENVIRONMENT' section because reading
	options from the environment was never supported. (One reason
	why this branch will never be called `stable'.)
	
	* lzma.spec: Added. Thanks to Michael J. Baysek.
	
	* Released LZMA Utils 4.32.0beta5. This time also the version
	number was updated.

2007-07-24  Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>

	* src/lzma/lzmp.cpp (main): Make "lzma -dc symlink.lzma"
	work as expected. Thanks to Per Ã˜yvind Karlsen.
	
	* Released LZMA Utils 4.32.0beta4.

2007-01-05  A. Costa <agcosta@gis.net>

	* src/lzma/lzma.1: Some typo fixes

2006-07-07  Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>

	* src/lzma/lzmp.cpp (parse_options): Changed type of c from
	char to int.
	* src/lzma/lzmp.cpp [!HAVE_FUTIMES]: Use futimesat() instead.
	This fixes building on Solaris. I will make a real fix for
	upcoming 4.42.x branch.
	* src/lzma_version.h, src/liblzmadec/main.c:
	Removed __attribute__ to increase portability. Again, a real
	fix will be in 4.42.x (Autoconf check).

	* Released LZMA Utils 4.32.0beta3.

2006-07-06  Guido Ostkamp <lzma@ostkamp.fastmail.fm>

	* src/sdk/Common/C_FileIO.h, src/sdk/Common/MyWindows.h:
	Fixed #include order to get config.h before others.

2006-06-30  Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>

	* Started some initial changelog, probably will stay incomplete
	with LZMA Utils 4.32.x branch, so please don't report if
	I have forgot to mention something in this changelog.
	I'm focusing on 4.42.x, but 4.32.0betas are worth keeping
	usable until 4.42.x is ready.

	* Fixed `make uninstall' to remove created symlinks.

	* Released LZMA Utils 4.32.0beta2

2006-06-30  Vanger <faijeya@gmail.com>

	* src/lzma/lzmp.cpp: Added signal handling.

2006-06-30  Nuno Cruces <ncruces@gmail.com>

	* src/lzma/lzmp.cpp (parse_options): Fix for path prefix
	removal when detecting how we were called.
