Andy: possible optimizations:
    only hash first 3 or 4 args of signature
    hashify symbol table
    rm transToType from varinitArg::trans
    run a perfect match through multimatch first (no casting allowed)
    STATIC_SYMBOL(name) define to avoid retranslating symbols in addOps
    change camp.y to flag arglists with named args
    remove addFunctionOps in favor of == and != defined in types.h
    remove most makesymbols in camp.l
    
Andy: operator tuple, to let people define their own tuples

Andy: implement operator init(A a) copy constructors.

Andy and John: (if possible) automatically turn expressions with array
sub-expressions into iteration over the array(s)

Andy: Decide if we should change vm::error to em in application.cc

John or Andy: Add unit test for AddOps.

Andy: Fix: void f(int x=blah);

Andy: Investigate adding unicode support for identifiers, using iswalpha,
mbtowc, etc.
