Andy: Investigate bbox error in uofa-talk Shadowing slide

Andy: make var work in extended for

Andy: change label in coder to a class not an Int

Andy: possible optimizations:
    overloaded::simplify copies
    straight guide which references a subset of a pair vector.
    Is it cheaper to import a bltin module than to call base_venv again?
    varpush+pop --> no op
    varsave+pop --> one op
    closure+pushfunc+varsave+pop --> savefunc
    stack::popWithoutReturningValue
    look at position information saved in program, maybe save separately
    formal::addOps calls trans
    only hash first 3 or 4 args of signature
    rm transToType from varinitArg::trans
    change camp.y to flag arglists with named args

Andy: testing in errortest.asy for packing versus casting, default argument
ambiguities, and whatever else you can think of
    
Andy: operator tuple, to let people define their own tuples

Andy: implement operator init(A a) copy constructors.

Andy and John: (if possible) automatically turn expressions with array
sub-expressions into iteration over the array(s)

Andy: Decide if we should change vm::error to em in application.cc

John or Andy: Add unit test for AddOps.

Andy: Fix: void f(int x=blah);

Andy: Investigate adding unicode support for identifiers, using iswalpha,
mbtowc, etc.
