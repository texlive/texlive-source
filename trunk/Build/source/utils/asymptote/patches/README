The optional patches to flex-2.5.31 and bison-2.0a in this directory fix a
number of problems with warning and/or error messages generated by strict
compilers.

A modified version of dvipdf that accepts common dvips options is included.

The file gcc3.3.2curses.patch can be used to patch the broken curses.h header
files (or a local copy thereof in the current directory) on some AIX and
IRIX systems.

The file gc6.8_AIX.patch fixes an incorrect Boehm garbage collector
prototype in the file gc6.8/include/gc.h (version 6.8).

The file gc-7.0nomem.patch avoids segmentation faults with gc-7.0 on
out-of-memory errors.

A patch to provide full functionality in the Asymptote backend to pstoedit
(http://pstoedit.net) is provided in the file pstoedit-3.45asy.patch.

The file TkAlpha-Imaging-1.1.6.patch is a revised patch that fixes
transparency support in PIL for xasy (this supercedes an obsolete patch
of the same name included in Asymptote 1.36, which resulted in very slow
rendering). Application of this patch is strongly recommended.

The file movie15_dvipdfmx.patch brings the xelatex/dvipdfmx-enhanced
version of movie15.sty available at
http://cvs.ktug.or.kr/viewcvs/dvipdfmx/contrib/latex/movie15.sty.sample?revision=1.1
up-to-date with the latest official 2008/10/08 version. For convenience the
patched version is also included as movie15_dvipdfmx.sty; it should be
renamed to movie15.sty and installed in the local latex directory.

The file movie15_20090323.patch works around a problem with 3Dgetview that
shows up under Windows XP in the 2009/03/23 version of movie15.sty.
