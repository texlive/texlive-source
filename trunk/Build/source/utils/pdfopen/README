Pdfopen 0.51 - Send open/close commands to Acrobat Reader
---------------------------------------------------------

This is a Linux (X11) implementation of Fabrice Popineau's pdfclose/
pdfopen commands to control the Acrobat Reader.

The libX code was borrowed from Reinhard Fobbe's Sendx library for 
Tcl/Tk, and the programs use the same license, copied below. 

Version 0.3 adds support for Adobe Reader 7.0 for Linux.
(different window titles and key shortcuts)

Version 0.4 uses autoconf

Version 0.5 fixes an incorrect autoconf variable, supports
building under X11R5, handles pathnames on the command-line, 
and  fixes a bug where pdfopen did not exit correctly after 
(automatically) starting acroread.

Version 0.51 uses the strrchr() function instead of rindex() 
to allow compilation on non-BSD derived unix platforms.

The command lines do not behave precisely the same as under Windows, 
because the Linux Reader behaves somewhat different: it is not 
scriptable, but it is possible to 'fake' keypresses.

Both commands have only one meaningful argument:

  pdfclose --file <pdfname>
    Closes an existing window with the name <pdfname>

  pdfopen --file <pdfname>
    Opens a window with the name <pdfname> (starting a reader if
    necesary), or it reloads <pdfname> if it was already open.

Note: <pdfname> is the name of the X window, not a filename.


Without argument, the pdfopen program sends a "Ctrl-<-" to an existing X
window with the name "Acrobat Reader", and "Alt-<-" to a window with the 
name "Adobe Reader", if such windows exist.

The --all and --page arguments of Fabrice's programs are silently ignored.
