LZMA utils

    LZMA utils consist of a few relatively separate submodules:
      * LZMA encoder/decoder command line tool similar to gzip/bzip2
      * Scripts to ease grepping, diffing and viewing (lz*grep,
        lzdiff/lzcmp, lzmore/lzless)
      
      * liblzmadec - LZMA decoder library written in C
      * lzmadec - Small LZMA decoder command line tool using liblzmadec
      * lzmainfo - Simple tool to view header information from LZMA
        encoded files; uses liblzmadec

      * Patch for GNU tar 1.15.1 adding --lzma and -Y command line options.
