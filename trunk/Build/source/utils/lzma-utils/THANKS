Over 90% of code in the LZMA utils is
taken as is from the LZMA SDK. Without
LZMA SDK there couldn't be LZMA utils:
- Igor Pavlov

Man pages and messages of LZMA.sh have
many similarities to gzip and bzip2:
- gzip's author Jean-loup Gailly
- gzip's co-author Mark Adler
- bzip2's author Julian Seward

Also thanks to all the people
participating the Tukaani project
and others who have helped.
