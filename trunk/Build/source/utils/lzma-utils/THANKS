Also thanks to all the people who have participated the Tukaani project

Note that while I tend to add names of bug reporters to the above list,
I don't separately ask for people's real names. If all I know about you
is your IRC or forum nick and you would like to get listed here, please
contact me via IRC or email, thanks. -- Larhzu
