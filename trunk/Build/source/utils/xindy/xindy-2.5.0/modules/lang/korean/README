Subject: Korean modules for Xindy

Dear Mr. Schrod,

This is Kihwang Lee from the Korean TeX users group.
I am maintaining a set of Korean typesetting packages and I have
recently uploaded them to CTAN.
(The most recent upload was done today and it was not processed at the
time of writing)
In one of the packages (kotex-utils), Korean modules for Xindy are
included, and I am contacting you following the advice from Karl Berry.

The module files are utf8-lang.xdy and utf8.xdy (both attached). The
core component is utf8.xdy which provides
a sorting order for Korean index entries. Initially we provided a
additional perl script for preprocessing the Korean index entries. Now
we removed the perl script and rewritten the module files that can be
used without any preprocessing.
Could you incorporate our files into Xindy? We admit that utf8.xdy is
not generated by the make-rules package.

Best wishes,

Kihwang
