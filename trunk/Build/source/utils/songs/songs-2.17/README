I. Overview

The Songs package is for producing songbooks containing lyrics and chords
(but not sheet music).  Each songs document can produce a lyric-only songbook
for singers, a chorded songbook for musicians, a set of overhead
transparencies, or a set of digital projector slides, all from a single master
document.  It can also automatically generate partial songbooks consisting of
only some songs from the master document in a specified order.  Facilities for
automatic transposition and creation of guitar tablature diagrams are also
included.

III. System Requirements

In order to install and run this software, you will need:

1. a C compiler (included on all Unix systems),
2. a LaTeX2e installation (by default, the installation tries "pdflatex"),
3. tar and gzip programs (to unpack the songs-x.xx.tar.gz file), and
4. an installation of GNU Make (to run the Makefile).


IV. Installation Instructions

1. Unpack the songs-x.xx.tar.gz file (where x.xx is the version number).

     tar -xzf songs-x.xx.tar.gz

2. Change directory to the songs directory and run the configure script.

     cd songs-x.xx
     ./configure

3. Run GNU Make (other versions of Make are not supported).  To be sure that
you are using GNU Make and not some other version of Make, use the "gmake"
command:

     gmake

4. If you only intend to use the software by editing files within the
songs-x.xx directory tree (i.e., a single-user installation), then you don't
need to perform the following final step.  However, to allow other users to
access the software or to build song books yourself in other directories, you
must next install the binary programs, LaTeX style files, index data files,
and Vim support scripts in appropriate places on your system.  To do so, make
the "install" target and specify a directory prefix equal to a fresh sub-
directory in your home directory:

     gmake install prefix=~/mysongs

This will create a ~/mysongs directory tree containing the files that need to
be installed.  Here is a summary of what it contains:

     bin:            Contains executable programs.
     share/doc:      Contains package documentation.
     share/texmf:    Contains the main LaTeX style file.
     share/songs:    Contains the *.can data files used by songidx when
                       generating scripture indexes.
     share/vimfiles: Contains support scripts for Vim (optional).

Each of these must be copied to an appropriate place on your system.  For
example, the following commands copy the files to appropriate places in a
typical /usr/local tree:

     cp ~/mysongs/bin/* /usr/local/bin
     cp -r ~/mysongs/share/doc/songs /usr/local/share/doc
     cp -r ~/mysongs/share/songs /usr/local/share
     cp -r ~/mysongs/share/texmf/tex /usr/local/texmf
     cp -r ~/mysongs/share/vimfiles/* /usr/local/share/vim/vimfiles

Alternatively, the following copies them to appropriate places in a typical
single-user home directory structure:

     cp ~/mysongs/bin/* ~/bin
     cp -r ~/mysongs/share/doc/songs ~/doc
     cp -r ~/mysongs/share/songs ~/data
     cp -r ~/mysongs/share/texmf/tex ~/localtexmf
     cp -r ~/mysongs/share/vimfiles/* ~/.vim

Note: After copying new files into the texmf tree, many LaTeX distributions
require you to execute the texhash command to update LaTeX's file name
database.  Be sure to do so if your version of LaTeX requires it:

     texhash


V. Usage

After running "gmake" from the songs-x.xx directory (step 3 above) you should
find the following file clusters:

A. LaTeX Package Style File and Documentation

In songs/src/songs you will find:
* src/songs/songs.sty: If you don't use "gmake install" to install this LaTeX
  style file in the system's TeX repository tree, then songs.sty must be copied
  into each directory that has a .tex file that uses the songs package.  (This
  is done automatically by the makefile that generates the sample book, so if
  you reuse that makefile as recommended in part C below, you don't need to
  copy it manually.)
* src/songs/songs.pdf: Comprehensive documentation of the songs package.

B. Sample Song Books

The GNUmakefile in songs/sample generates the sample song books.  There are
four books in total:

* sample/chordbook.pdf: a chord book for musicians,
* sample/lyricbook.pdf: a lyric book for singers,
* sample/slidebook.pdf: a book of slides for use with a digital projector, and
* sample/transparencies.pdf: book of transparencies for an overhead projector

All four books draw upon the song data contained in the file songs.sbd.  By
modifying that file, you can change the content of all four books.  To change
the formatting style of any particular book, change the corresponding
sample/*.tex file.

C. Creating a New Song Book

You can create a new song book directory by copying the sample directory and
its contents to a new subdirectory:

     cp -r sample mybook
     cd mybook
     gmake clean
     gmake

If you have used "gmake install" to install the software (see Section III.4)
then your new "mybook" directory can be located anywhere; otherwise it must be
in the songs-x.xx directory.

D. Support Utilities (songidx and sbdchk)

* songs/src/songidx/songidx: This program is required for auto-generating song
  book indexes.  The GNUmakefile in songs/sample invokes it automatically as
  necessary.
* songs/src/sbdchk/sbdchk: The sbdchk program is a utility that proofs .sbd
  files for chord placement errors.  Chords are misplaced if they fall at an
  invalid hyphenation point or they break a ligature.  To use sbdchk with the
  sample song books, change to the songs/sample directory and type

     gmake sbdcheck

  This will generate a report file named songs.hyp in the current directory.


VI. Removal / Reinstallation

To reverse the behavior of "make install", type:

     gmake uninstall

To merely delete all generated files within the songs directory (without
deleting the non-generated files), type:

     gmake clean
