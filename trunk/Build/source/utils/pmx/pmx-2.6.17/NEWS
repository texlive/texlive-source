2.610

Instrument-wise transposition: Ki[instrument #][+/-][trans
amt.][+/-][new key]. For more than one instrument, may immediately
repeat everything after "K". Must either be at start of score (right
after setup), or if later, must be preceded by normal (full score) key
change command K+0[+/-][new key]. Must be used with relative accidentals
("Ar"). Part(s) to be transposed must be entered in concert key, and
will appear transposed in the score. MIDI behavior not yet tested.
Has not yet been integrated into scor2prt, so for now if you want to
make parts, only use Ki... as score-only (on line after "%%") and/or
instrument only (on same line after %[Instrument #]).

2.613

Set error trap if "D" is entered before any notes.

Enhance "AS" to allow spacing adjustments tailored for either smallsize
or tinysize. As before, "AS" must be followed by nv characters, but now
they may be "0" for normal, "-" or "s" for small, or "t" for tiny. Still
must set sizes of instruments with inline TeX. 

Bugfix: Fixed broken "K-..." in 2.610.

2.614

Bugfix: revise raised dotted rests by separately raising rest and dot. 

2.615 *(Note: new scor2prt)*

Command "AS", described above under 2.163, now also causes staff sizes
to change (in score only, not parts), so inline TeX is no longer needed
to change sizes of selected staves. 

Scor2prt transfers partwise transposition commands Ki... (see 2.610
above) into parts.

2.616

"Feature" added: Hairpin dynamics now may span input blocks.

2.617

Repaired several obscure bugs related to platform and compiler
dependencies; see pmxab.f for details.
