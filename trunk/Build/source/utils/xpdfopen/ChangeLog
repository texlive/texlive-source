	* pdfclose.c: make it work with all of AR{5,7,8,9} and xpdf.
	* pdfopen.c:  add ability to parse and send function-keys.
		      Add code (commented out) in an attempt to
		      support okular (see code comments).
	* sendx.c:    add code (commented out) in an attempt to
		      support okular (see code comments).
	* configure.ac: add changes suggested by Peter Breitenlohner.

	* utils.[ch]: put a function to create window titles there
	* xpdfopen.h: put constants related to the titles of various
	              PDF viewers there
	* pdfclose.c: modify to use utils.c and xpdfopen.h
	* pdfopen.c:  major modifications so it works with AR7, AR8, AR9
	              xpdf and maybe AR5, and so that it might be
		      relatively straightforward to add other PDF viewers.
		      The default viewer is AR9, this can be overridden
		      by an environment variable and a command-line
		      argument.
	* sendx.c:    Reset the error status in open_channel() so that an
		      error return doesn't become permanent.
		      Fixed mask param in XSendEvent().

	* pdfopen.c: Fold in some changes submitted by
		     Peter Breitenlohner <tex-live@tug.org>
	* pdfopen.c: Fold in some changes submitted by
		     Peter Breitenlohner <tex-live@tug.org>
		     and reformat the code.


2010-04-11  Jim Diamond <jim.diamond@acadiau.ca>

	* pdfopen.c: Update (in a non-backward-compatible way) to
		     work with AR 9.  Save old version in pdfopen-AR-7-and-8.c.

	Avoid maximal compiler warnings.
	* pdfopen.c: Use strdup'ed literal string (malloc+strcpy) to
	initialize non-constant string.
	* sendx.[ch]: Constify string args of all functions.
	Consistently use wname for window name string param.
	(close_channel): ANSI C function definition.


2009-08-19  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* Makefile.am (AM_CFLAGS), configure.ac: Enable compiler warnings.
	* pdfopen.c (usage), pdfclose.c (usage): Declare as static.

	* sendx.h (new): Declare prototypes for functions in sendx.c.
	* Makefile.am (pdfopen_SOURCES, pdfclose_SOURCES): Add sendx.h.
	* pdfopen.c, pdfclose.c, sendx.c: #include "sendx.h".

	* sendx.c (GetRootWindow): Slightly reformulate to avoid compiler
	warning (strict-aliasing rules).


2009-05-06  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	Adapt to TL2009 build system.
