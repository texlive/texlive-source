  xindy requires GNU clisp and GNU libffcall.  If you can find
  prepackaged versions for your system, go ahead and use them; their
  precise version shouldn't matter.
  
  If you need or want to compile them from source, here is what karl did
  on i386-linux -- but install the latest GNU libtool first:

wget http://www.haible.de/bruno/gnu/ffcall-1.10.tar.gz
tar xf ffcall-1.10.tar.gz && cd ffcall-1.10
configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnu --enable-shared \
&& make && make install  # as usual

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/clisp/latest/clisp-2.44.1.tar.gz
tar xf clisp-2.44.1.tar.gz && cd clisp-2.44.1
configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnu --ignore-absence-of-libsigsegv \
  --with-libffcall-prefix=/usr/local/gnu \
&& cd src && make && make install

  Of course, adjust paths as desired.

  clisp complains about my stack size being too small and I should run
  ulimit, but I ignored that.  (If you actually care about clisp per se,
  you should probably also install GNU libsigsegv; I didn't.)

  Both tarballs are also available at ftp://tug.org/dist.

  (Failed variation: clisp failed to link against static libffcall,
   apparently wanting a dynamic library.  Not sure if configure
   --without-dynamic-modules would have solved it.)
