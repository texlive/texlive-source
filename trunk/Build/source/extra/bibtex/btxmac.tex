% This file, btxmac.tex, contains TeX macros that allow BibTeX, a
% bibliography program that was originally designed for use with LaTeX,
% to work with plain TeX.  Please report any bugs (outright goofs,
% improvable macros, misfeatures, or unclear documentation) to Oren
% Patashnik (opbibtex@cs.stanford.edu).  These macros will become frozen
% shortly after BibTeX version 1.00 is released.
%
% AMS-TEX WARNING: We tried very hard, for version .99i of these macros,
% to make them compatible with AmS-TeX.  We succeeded to the extent
% that, if you use one of the standard bibliography styles, you probably
% won't notice any problems with version 0.99i of btxmac.tex.  But
% ultimately we failed, in that the inherent incompatibilities between
% plain TeX and AmS-TeX kept making these macros break, for certain
% inputs or certain styles.  Examples:  (1) AmS-TeX treats at-signs as
% special, in ways that plain TeX and LaTeX don't, so that, for example,
% you can't have any `@' characters in an argument to the \cite command,
% the way you can in TeX or LaTeX; (2) AmS-TeX decided that plain TeX's
% and LaTeX's macron-accent control sequence `\=' should be undefined;
% so you'll need to define `\=' to be `\B' to get the xampl.bib example
% suggested below to work with AmS-TeX; (3) AmS-TeX redefines the tie
% character `~' of plain TeX, and AmS-TeX's `amsppt' style redefines
% plain TeX's `\nobreak' macro, so that if you use an author-date style
% like `apalike' and you have a multiple-author reference for which the
% author-date style automatically produces a citation in the text like
% `(Jones et~al., 1992)' you will throw AmS-TeX's `amsppt' style into
% an infinite loop, exceeding its input stack size.  In practice, such
% incompatibilities surface infrequently; but it is now clear to us that
% it's not worth the effort (perhaps it's not even possible) to make the
% btxmac.tex macros robust when used both with plain TeX and Ams-TeX.
% If the BibTeX/AmS-TeX results attainable with the current btxmac.tex
% macros are sufficient, fine.  But if there's a demand for more robust
% BibTeX/AmS-TeX behavior, then someone who's very familiar with the
% AmS-TeX package should probably make an amsbtxmc.tex version of the
% macros (remembering to follow the copyright restrictions above).
% Until then, if you're an AmS-TeX user, or a LaTeX or plain TeX user
% sharing files with an AmS-TeX user, beware.
% END OF AMS-TEX WARNING.
%
% To use these macros you should be familiar with how BibTeX interacts
% with LaTeX, since BibTeX's interaction with TeX is very similar; that
% interaction is explained in the LaTeX manual.  It also helps to
% have read "BibTeXing", the documentation that accompanies BibTeX.
% Then, if you want, you should redefine any of the macros that begin
% with `\bbl' or `\biblabel' or `\print' that you need to get formatting
% different from the default (the default settings are designed to
% accompany a bibliography style like BibTeX's standard style `plain').
% The macros you might want to change are described briefly a few
% paragraphs hence.  [To get started without reading any documentation,
% try running the nine-line .tex file below through TeX and BibTeX.
% Remember the general scheme: Running (La)TeX writes information on
% the .aux (auxiliary) file; then running BibTeX reads information from
% the .aux, .bst (style), and .bib (database) files, and writes
% information (the bibliography) on a .bbl file; then running (La)TeX
% incorporates the bibliography; then running (La)TeX once more fixes
% the remaining forward references into the bibliography.  Thus, to get
% everything incorporated into your output, you'll have to run (La)TeX,
% BibTeX, (La)TeX, (La)TeX.  (Standup, sitdown, fight, fight, fight.)]
%
% These macros can stand alone or they can be \input into a macro
% package, like Eplain, that is sufficiently compatible with plain TeX.
% To use these macros to format the 0.99 version of the xampl.bib file
% that's distributed with BibTeX (that version of the file has no
% self-identification), you'll need to define \mbox, which is a LaTeX
% command, to be \hbox, as in the example below.
%
% Here's a nine-line plain TeX file for trying out btxmac.tex; of course
% you'll have to remove the comment characters at the beginning of each
% line, and, depending on your system, you might have to take steps so
% that BibTeX can "see" the files xampl.bib and plain.bst (BibTeX will
% give you two empty-field warning messages that you should ignore).
%
%     \def\mbox#1{\leavevmode\hbox{#1}}
%     \input btxmac
%     \noindent This cites Aamport's gnominious article~\cite{article-full}.
%     \medskip

%     \nocite{*}   % put all database entries into the reference list

%   HISTORY
%
% Karl Berry wrote the original version of these macros in 1989 and
% 1990, for use in his `Eplain' package.  Oren Patashnik modified them
% slightly in July 1990, as part of the official BibTeX distribution.
%
%    1-Aug-90  Version 0.99a, not released to the general public.
%   14-Aug-90  0.99b, first general release.
%   26-Aug-90  0.99c, made \@undefinedmessage work with other macro packages.
%    6-Sep-90  0.99d, allowed for general formatting of bibliography labels,
%                     for general formatting of (in-text) citations, and for
%                     changing certain catcodes while reading the .aux file.
%   14-Nov-90  0.99e, changed the way \@setletters works, made some \new...'s
%                     non-outer, and changed the way Eplain reads this file.
%   12-Dec-90  0.99f, made \@resetnumerals change the `,' and `.' catcodes; and
%                     added \biblabelextrahang, \@getoptionalarg, and \bblsc.
%   11-Mar-91  0.99g, made a few minor changes required by the way Eplain reads
%                     this file, but no functional changes.
%   24-Apr-91  0.99h, inhibited the reading and writing of the .aux file if it
%                     isn't used or if the \noauxfile macro is defined, and
%                     removed some .aux-file-opening detritus; printed the
%                     cite-key of undefined citations in \tt font; changed the
%                     catcode of `_' inside \cite; and called \@resetnumerals
%                     from inside a group.
%   29-Feb-92  0.99i, made these macros semi-compatible with AmS-TeX; removed
%                     \@resetnumerals, \@setletters, \@tokstostring, and
%                     friends; changed the way \cite handles catcodes; changed
%                     \@getoptionalarg, and had \bibitem and \newcommand use
%                     it; added \@futurenonspacelet and (to facilitate the use
%                     of multiple reference lists) \bblfilebasename; changed
%                     \biblabelprint to use the new macros \biblabelprecontents
%                     and \biblabelpostcontents, and to, by default, right-
%                     justify numeric labels; and renamed \biblabelextrahang to
%                     the more descriptive \biblabelextraspace.
%   14-Mar-92  0.99j, made 0.99i's use of `\\' local to btxmac.tex.
%   13-Nov-95  0.99k, defined \begin and \end (while reading bbl file) only if
%                     it wasn't already defined.
%
%
% The LaTeX-related commands defined in this file include (a) the four
% commands that a user types (\bibliography, \bibliographystyle, \cite,
% and \nocite); (b) the three commands that BibTeX looks for in the .aux
% file (\bibdata, \bibstyle, and \citation---there is a fourth command
% that BibTeX looks for, but that command is related to LaTeX's \include
% facility, so these macros ignore that command); and (c) a LaTeX
% command (\newcommand) that's written by one of the four standard
% bibliography styles (alpha).  The definitions here are not exactly the
% same as the corresponding LaTeX definitions (those eight LaTeX
% definitions depend on a significant fraction of LaTeX itself).  But
% the only substantial differences are with \newcommand, which here,
% without complaining, lets you redefine a preexisting control sequence
% (in LaTeX, \newcommand won't let you redefine a preexisting command),
% and which here doesn't make the control sequences it defines \long (in
% LaTeX, that happens automatically); there may also be other minor
% differences.  To summarize: Unless you know what you're doing, you
% shouldn't define any control sequences with these eight names:
%
% \bibdata
% \bibliography
% \bibliographystyle
% \bibstyle
% \citation
% \cite
% \newcommand
% \nocite
%
% There are three other commands written by one or more of the four
% standard (plain, abbrv, alpha, unsrt) or four semistandard (acm,
% apalike, ieeetr, siam) bibliography styles; they take effect only
% within the bibliography, and are redefinable, as explained later:
%
% \em
% \newblock
% \sc
%
% There's one control sequence you might want to use (but not redefine)
% in redefining \biblabelprint:
%
% \biblabelwidth
%
% There are fifteen other control sequences (explained later in more detail)
% that the macros of this file will use if you define them---you should
% define them after the \input btxmac command but before the \bibliography
% command.  The first six begin with `\bbl' and affect fonts, spacing,
% perhaps other characteristics of the bibliography, and which .bbl files
% get read; the next five begin with `\biblabel' and determine how labels
% are formatted in the bibliography; and the last four begin with `\print'
% and determine how the in-text citations are formatted:
%
% \bblem
% \bblfilebasename
% \bblhook
% \bblnewblock
% \bblrm
% \bblsc
% \biblabelcontents
% \biblabelprecontents
% \biblabelprint
% \biblabelpostcontents
% \biblabelextraspace
% \printbetweencitations
% \printcitefinish
% \printcitenote
% \printcitestart
%
% If it's defined before the \input btxmac command, the control sequence
% below inhibits the reading and writing of the .aux file(s), and the
% issuing of related warning messages.  Any definition will do.  This
% feature might help when you're working on draft stages of a document:
%
% \noauxfile
%
%
% Here's another control sequence (it's described later) that you
% probably won't want to redefine unless you are writing another macro
% package; if you do redefine it, however, do it before the \input btxmac
% command (and notice that it has an `@' in its name):
%
% \@undefinedmessage
%
% Any other control sequence in this file that might conflict with
% something you've defined will have an `@' in its name, so such conflicts
% are unlikely; but if you're worried about a specific control sequence
% name, do a text search of this file to look for it.
%
%
% So to start things off we turn `@' into a letter (category code 11),
% keeping track of the old category code for future restoration.
% (Simply resetting it to 12 when we leave these macros is
% insufficient.)  The use of `\cite' as a temporary control sequence is
% a kludge, but it's a reasonably simple way to accomplish what we need
% without possibly overwriting something (without an `@' in its name)
% that might already be defined.
%
\edef\cite{\the\catcode`@}%
\catcode`@ = 11
\let\@oldatcatcode = \cite
\chardef\@letter = 11
\chardef\@other = 12
%
%
% Next come some things that will be useful later.
%
% Make an outer definition into an inner one (due to Chris Thompson).
% The arguments should be the control sequence to be defined, and the
% new of the \outer control sequence, as characters; the control
% sequence #1 is defined to be just the same as \csname#2\endcsname, but
% not \outer.  For example, \@innerdef\innernewcount{newcount} would
% define \innernewcount to be a non-outer version of \newcount.
%
\def\@innerdef#1#2{\edef#1{\expandafter\noexpand\csname #2\endcsname}}%
%
% We use \@innerdef to make some of our allocations local, because

% names to minimize the (already small) chance of conflicts.
