Public domain.  Originally written 2010 by Karl Berry.

This directory contains things which are not part of the TeX Live build,
but only present for convenience.

djgpp support here is probably obsolete, but just in case.

epstopdf is developed here because I didn't feel like making a separate
  repository.

xz-* is here so TL builders can easily get it
