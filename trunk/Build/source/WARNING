	CONSTRUCTION WORK
	=================

The TeX Live build system is currently under reconstruction.

At the moment the `Build' script should succeed, but might as well fail.

Please inform me of any failures!

The new build system is nearly complete, except for the directories

	texk/web2c/xetexdir
	utils/xindy

and a few features not yet available.
