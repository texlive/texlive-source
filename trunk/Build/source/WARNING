	CONSTRUCTION WORK
	=================

The TeX Live build system is currently under reconstruction.

At the moment the `Build' script will fail.

In about a day everything should be OK, except that the directories

	texk/texlive
	texk/dvipng
	texk/xdvik
	texk/web2c/xetexdir

are not yet integrated and a few features not yet available.
