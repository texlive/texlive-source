	CONSTRUCTION WORK
	=================

The TeX Live build system is currently under reconstruction.  It is now
nearly complete, except for the directory
	utils/xindy/
and a few features not yet available.  Moreover the directory
	texk/xdvik/
still needs some work, and building in that subdirectory may fail.

My builds on i686-linux and i686-Darwin both went through without any
problems.

Please try ./Build for your system and tell me about any failures.

If building a particular subdirectory, e.g., texk/xdvik/ fails, try
	TL_CONFIGURE_ARGS='--disable-xdvik' ./Build
(assuming a bourne compatible shell).

If there are problems with the cxx-runtime-hack (gcc only), please try adding
'--disable-cxx-runtime-hack' to TL_CONFIGURE_ARGS.

Good luck!
