	CONSTRUCTION WORK
	=================

The TeX Live build system is currently under reconstruction.  It is now
nearly complete, except for the directory
	utils/xindy/
and a few features not yet available.  Moreover the directory
	texk/xdvik/
still needs some work, and building in that subdirectory may fail.

My builds on i686-linux and i686-Darwin both went through without any
problems.

Please try ./Build for your system and tell me about any failures.

Make sure to use GNU Make (an Automake generated Makefile is supposed not to
require GNU Make, but that seems not to be the case).

If /bin/sh on your system can not handle command substitutions such as
'$(COMMAND)' and XSI constructs such as 'VAR+=VAL', you must set
CONFIG_SHELL to a shell that does.  Due to a bug in current Autoconf this
should be done both in the environment and on the command line, e.g.,
	CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash ./Build CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
(assuming bourne shell syntax).

If building a particular subdirectory, e.g., texk/xdvik/ fails, try
	TL_CONFIGURE_ARGS='--disable-xdvik' ./Build
(again assuming bourne shell syntax).

If there are problems with the cxx-runtime-hack (gcc only), please try adding
'--disable-cxx-runtime-hack' to TL_CONFIGURE_ARGS.

Good luck!
